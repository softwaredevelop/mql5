# Fisher Transform Professional

## 1. Summary (Introduction)

The Fisher Transform, developed by John Ehlers, is a powerful technical indicator designed to convert any price or indicator data into a waveform that has a nearly Gaussian (normal) probability distribution. The primary purpose of this transformation is to make market turning points **sharper, clearer, and more timely**.

Unlike traditional oscillators (like MACD or RSI) which often have rounded tops and bottoms, the Fisher Transform creates sharp, V-shaped peaks and troughs. This "amplification" of extreme price movements helps traders identify potential reversals with greater precision and less lag.

The indicator plots two lines:

* **Fisher Line:** The main transformed value.
* **Signal Line:** The Fisher line delayed by one bar, used for generating crossover signals.

Our `Fisher_Transform_Pro` implementation is a unified, professional version that allows the calculation to be based on either **standard** or **Heikin Ashi** price data.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations and Calculation Logic

The indicator follows a multi-step process to transform the price data.

### Required Components

* **Period (N):** A lookback period to normalize the price.
* **Alpha (Î±):** A smoothing factor for the normalized price.
* **Source Price (P):** The price series used for the calculation (Ehlers' original work uses the Median Price `(H+L)/2`).

### Calculation Steps (Algorithm)

1. **Price Normalization:** For each bar, find the highest high and lowest low over the last `N` periods. Use these values to normalize the current price into a range between -1 and +1.
2. **Smoothing:** Apply an EMA-like smoothing to the normalized value from the previous step using the `alpha` factor.
3. **Clamping:** The smoothed value is strictly limited (clamped) to a range just inside -1 and +1 (e.g., -0.999 to +0.999) to prevent mathematical errors in the next step.
4. **Fisher Transform Application:** Apply the core Fisher Transform equation to the clamped value (`x`):
    $y = 0.5 \times \ln\left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right)$
5. **Final Smoothing & Signal Line:** The resulting value (`y`) is lightly smoothed, and the Signal Line is generated as the previous bar's Fisher value.

## 3. MQL5 Implementation Details

* **Self-Contained Calculator (`Fisher_Transform_Calculator.mqh`):** The entire multi-stage calculation is encapsulated within a dedicated, reusable calculator class.
* **Heikin Ashi Integration:** An inherited `_HA` class allows the calculation to be performed seamlessly on smoothed Heikin Ashi data.
* **Stability via Full Recalculation:** The indicator employs a full recalculation on every `OnCalculate` call. This is the most robust method for a state-dependent indicator that involves smoothing and normalization.
* **Definition-True Price Source:** The calculator is hard-coded to use the **Median Price `(High+Low)/2`** as the source, in accordance with John Ehlers' original articles on this specific implementation.

## 4. Parameters

* **Period (`InpPeriod`):** The lookback period for normalizing the price. Ehlers' recommendation and a good starting point is **10**.
  * A shorter period makes the indicator more sensitive to recent price swings.
  * A longer period makes it smoother and responsive only to larger price movements.
* **Alpha (`InpAlpha`):** The smoothing factor for the normalized price, similar to an EMA's alpha. Ehlers' recommendation is **0.33**. It is generally not recommended to change this value.
* **Source (`InpSource`):** Selects between `Standard` and `Heikin Ashi` candles. The Median Price of the selected candle type will be used.

## 5. Usage and Interpretation

The Fisher Transform is primarily a **timing indicator** for identifying potential reversals.

### **1. Signal Line Crossover (Primary Strategy)**

This is the most direct way to use the indicator.

* **Buy Signal:** The **blue Fisher line crosses above the red Signal line**. This often occurs at or near a market bottom.
* **Sell Signal:** The **blue Fisher line crosses below the red Signal line**. This often occurs at or near a market top.

### **2. Trading Extreme Levels**

The sharp peaks and troughs are the indicator's main feature.

* When the Fisher line reaches an extreme level (e.g., above +1.5 or below -1.5), it signals that a reversal is becoming highly probable.
* A conservative strategy is to wait for the indicator to reach an extreme level and *then* wait for a signal line crossover in the opposite direction as confirmation before entering a trade.

### **Important Consideration: Use with a Trend Filter**

The Fisher Transform is designed to be very responsive and has no trend-following component. In a strong trend, it can generate multiple false signals against the trend. Therefore, it is **highly recommended to use it in conjunction with a trend filter** (e.g., a 100 or 200-period moving average).

* **Uptrend Rule:** Only take **Buy signals** from the Fisher Transform when the price is above the long-term moving average.
* **Downtrend Rule:** Only take **Sell signals** from the Fisher Transform when the price is below the long-term moving average.
