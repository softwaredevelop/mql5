# Supertrend Professional

## 1. Summary (Introduction)

The Supertrend indicator, developed by Olivier Seban, is a simple yet effective trend-following indicator. Plotted directly on the price chart, the Supertrend line changes color and position based on the market's trend, acting as a dynamic level of support or resistance.

Our `Supertrend_Pro` implementation is a unified, professional version that combines three distinct calculation methodologies into a single, flexible indicator:

1. **Standard:** Classic Supertrend using standard price data.
2. **HA-Hybrid:** A smoothed Supertrend based on Heikin Ashi prices, with channel width based on standard, real-market ATR.
3. **HA-Pure:** A fully smoothed Supertrend where both the trend calculation and the ATR are based on Heikin Ashi data.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations and Calculation Logic

The Supertrend indicator combines a measure of volatility (Average True Range - ATR) with a central price point to construct upper and lower bands.

### Required Components

* **ATR (Average True Range):** A measure of market volatility.
* **Factor (Multiplier):** A user-defined multiplier that adjusts the sensitivity.
* **Median Price (hl2):** The central point for the bands, calculated as `(High + Low) / 2`.

### Calculation Steps (Algorithm)

1. **Calculate the Average True Range (ATR)**.
2. **Calculate the Basic Upper and Lower Bands.**
3. **Calculate the Final Upper and Lower Bands** using the "stair-step" logic.
4. **Determine the Trend Direction** by comparing the closing price to the opposite band.
5. **Plot the Supertrend Line:** Plot the Final Lower Band in an uptrend, and the Final Upper Band in a downtrend.

## 3. MQL5 Implementation Details

Our MQL5 implementation follows a modern, component-based, object-oriented design.

* **Component-Based Design:** The `Supertrend_Calculator` **reuses** our existing, standalone `ATR_Calculator.mqh` module, ensuring the ATR component is always our robust, definition-true Wilder's ATR.

* **Object-Oriented Logic:** An elegant inheritance model (`CSupertrendCalculator` and `CSupertrendCalculator_HA`) allows the indicator to seamlessly switch between standard and Heikin Ashi price data for its core logic.

* **Clean Gapped-Line Drawing:** To provide a clear visual separation at trend changes, the indicator uses a **"double buffer" technique**. It plots uptrend and downtrend segments on two separate, overlapping plot buffers. This creates a distinct visual gap when the trend flips, accurately representing the signal without drawing misleading connecting lines.

* **Stability via Full Recalculation:** We employ a "brute-force" full recalculation within `OnCalculate` for maximum stability.

## 4. Parameters

* **ATR Period (`InpAtrPeriod`):** The lookback period for the ATR calculation. Default is `10`.
* **Factor (`InpFactor`):** The multiplier applied to the ATR value. Default is `3.0`.
* **Candle Source (`InpCandleSource`):** Determines the source for the Supertrend's price component (`(High+Low)/2` and `Close`).
* **ATR Source (`InpAtrSource`):** Determines the source for the ATR calculation (`Standard` or `Heikin Ashi`), allowing you to create "Hybrid" or "Pure" HA versions.

## 5. Usage and Interpretation

* **Trend Identification:** A green line below the price indicates an uptrend. A red line above the price indicates a downtrend.
* **Trailing Stop-Loss:** The indicator is exceptionally well-suited for use as a trailing stop-loss.
* **Trade Signals:** A change in the indicator's color can be interpreted as a trade signal.
* **Caution:** Like all trend-following indicators, Supertrend is most effective in trending markets. In sideways or ranging markets, it can produce frequent false signals ("whipsaws").
